Registration periods last for 15 minutes and occur every two hours (Earth time). If registering as a party, the party leader must register. The ship will depart when 24 crew members have been assembled or the registration period has ended, even if there are fewer than 24 crew members. Registration times may be viewed from the Sailing Schedule.\n\nProgressing through the main scenario will give access to an additional route known as the Ruby route.

However, simply selling lots of a popular item will result in Overflowing supply for future cycles, which may ultimately undercut potential earnings.\n\nBy waiting to sell a popular handicraft during cycles in which its supply is Nonexistent, you can optimize your profits while keeping the markets in balance.\n\nDemand Shift may prove a helpful indicator of how supply levels will behave in coming cycles. For example, if an Insufficient handicraft is showing a Skyrocketing demand shift, one might reasonably expect it to reach Nonexistent supply by the following cycle.\n\n\n\u25A0Start the Season Short and Efficient\nLevels of groove increase with the number of efficiency bonuses activated during production. Therefore, securing as many efficiency bonuses as you can at the beginning of a season allows you to benefit from the effects of maximum groove for longer.\n\nTo quickly activate efficiency bonuses, schedule applicable handicrafts that require relatively short production times. Handicrafts that take longer to produce typically fetch a higher price, so waiting to create these items until groove is high will maximize your earnings without flooding supply.\n\nStrategically utilizing factors such as groove and paying close attention to production time will help increase the value of the handicrafts you sell.",

So what are you waiting for? Activate those efficiency bonuses by following the steps below!\n\n\u25A0Activating Efficiency Bonuses\nAll handicrafts belong to at least one item category, such as \u201CConcoctions\u201D or \u201CConfections.\u201D\n\nEfficiency bonuses are activated by scheduling the production of similarly categorized items in direct succession.\n\nFor example, an isleworks potion and isleworks firesand are both classified as \u201CConcoctions.\u201D By scheduling production of isleworks firesand right after your isleworks potion, you will activate an efficiency bonus that creates two pinches of isleworks firesand with the same time and materials it would normally take to make one!\n\nBut you don\u0027t have to keep track of all your bonuses in that steel-trap mind of yours\u2500the text \u201CEfficiency Bonus!\u201D will appear on the agenda for items that will be produced twice as a result of your clever scheduling.",
